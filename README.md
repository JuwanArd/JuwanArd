## Brief Introduction
I'm a mental health advocate and love to solve issues both in technology and within our own minds. Helping others, solving issues, and working with technology are my passions. 

## Objective

My desire to bridge the gap between human psychology, and technology has led me to the field of cybersecurity. I am very excited to establish a foothold into the field by becoming part of a security operations center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, working my way up from there and potentially running my own team one day.
